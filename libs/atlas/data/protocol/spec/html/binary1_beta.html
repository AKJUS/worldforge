        <P> The Atlas binary1_beta2 codec is a binary codec for the Atlas protocol.  
            It defines type flags and specific binary encoding methods for each supported type.
            This particular version includes all basic Atlas primitives, but does not provide
            support for advanced features such as sized numeric types, user defined types, arrays, tunneling self
            encoded byte streams, or secondary transport layer connections such as UDP.

        Atlas types are encoded as integers.  Bit 6 is not anymore
        reserved for possible future use as an array type flag. Array
        types will be defined by user in binary2. The current type

          Most Atlas primitives are encoded as 'type' followed by 'value'.  
          The Atlas 'type' is encoded as a positive integer.

          <LI> Integer encoding - bit 7 is used as a flag to indicate the presence of additional bytes,
               Thus each byte represents a magnitude of 0-127 and each subsequent byte position has a
               multiplier of 128 * the previous byte position's multiplier.  Of course the first byte
               has a multiplier of 0.  This allows for integers of any size.
          </LI>
          <LI> Normal Floats are encoded as mantissa exponent pairs with both the mantissa and exponent represented
               as integers.  Special floats have a single integer value, 0 = NaN, 
               1 = +Infinity, 2 = -Infinity.
          </LI>
          <LI> Strings are encoded as a length integer followed by a sequence of length bytes </LI>
          <LI> Lists are encoded as a size integer followed by size * ( type, value ) pairs </LI>
          <LI> Maps are encoded as a size integer followed by size * (type, name, value ) triplets where
               name is encoded as a string value. </LI>
          <LI> Unknown length strings/lists/maps are encoded just like normal, 
                except that after this sequence follows either another unknown length sequence or 
                known length sequence (fixed length string/list/map). 
                String/list/map started with unknown length type 
                always end with fixed length sequence of same type. </LI>
