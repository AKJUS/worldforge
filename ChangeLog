2001-03-12  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* Updated ROADMAP and NEWS to latest versions from stable branch.

	* Modified docs to indicate new maintainer.

2001-03-10  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/Codec.*, src/Codecs/*: Ported across simplified ISO compliant
	  Codec classes from stable branch. Removed Metrics and Parameters.
	  
	* src/Filter.*, src/Filters/*: Removed Metrics and Parameters.

	* src/Factory.*: Removed Factory mechanism, changes copied from
	  stable branch.

	* src/Net/Stream.*: Changed negotiation classes to simplified but
	  ISO compliant version from stable branch, with placeholder
	  code for Filter negotiation.

	* HACKING: Copied across from stable branch, and modified to reflect
	  status of this branch.

	* README: Updated contents from the stable branch.

	* tutorial/example/*: Created similar tutorial to that on stable
	  branch. The only differences are differences to the API.

	* src/Filter.h, Makefile.am: Sorted out using config.h in Filter.h.

	* src/Filters/*: Moved filters into their own namespace,
	  in accordance with the convention used throughout this
	  library.

	* src/*: Removed all "using namespace .." directives.

2001-03-08  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/*: Removed "using namespace std;" throughout code, as all
	  uses of symbols in this namespace are now fully qualified.

2001-03-07  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/*: Backed off changes to namespaces and template classes with
	  Stream parameter, as they proved to be of no benefit to portability.

	* src/*: Finished off a bit more ISO conformance. (all std:: additions).

	* src/Message/Object.h: Copied changes from stable branch
	  including memory pool optimisation, asNum() and isNum() methods, and
	  change of ListType from std::list to std::vector.

	* src/*: Replaced int with long throughout code for compatability
	  with changes type in Message::Object

2001-01-05  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/Filter.h: added filterbuf. Input filtering is not
	    implemented yet.
	* configure.am: added check for <streambuf>. You will need an
	    automike with a C++ check for this.
	* configure.in: regenerated from new configure.am.
	* TODO: updated todo list.
	* src/Net/Stream.h: identified a problem. Look for XXX.

2001-01-04  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/*: made everything ISO C++ conforming, from what I can see
	    (mainly a great number of std:: additions).

2000-12-22  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Removed dependency on socket++ in test programs.

	* Added atlas.m4 autoconf macro script.

2000-12-21  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Split filters into header and cpp file in the same model
	  as Codecs.

	* Re-worked tutorial, test and benchmarks so they compile without
	  installing the library.

2000-12-20  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Removed hierarchical namespaces, leaving single flat Atlas
	  namespace.

	* Reduced template usage, especially removing all Stream
	  templates.

	* Split codecs into header and cpp file, and removed static Codec
	  instances.

	* Re-worked factories() static member function in Factory
	  so it now uses portable static list pointer instead of static
	  list.

2000-12-19  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added atlas-config script.

2000-12-13  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added first attempt at a UML class diagram.

2000-12-09  Aloril  <aloril@iki.fi>

	* added bool instanceOf(int classNo) const; method

2000-12-08  Aloril  <aloril@iki.fi>

	* Decoder::unknownObjectArrived(const Entity::Empty&); ->
	Decoder::objectArrived(const Entity::Anonymous&);

	* s/Empty/Anonymous/

	* added Atlas::Objects::Entity::Empty class which is used when
 	unknown object has arrived (usually unknown objects have pos
 	attribute, which is dynamic in Root):
	Decoder::unknownObjectArrived(const Entity::Empty&);
	and for args: if(op->getArgs()[0]->getClassNo() == Entity::EMPTY_NO) ...

2000-12-02  Aloril  <aloril@iki.fi>

	* changed method names: FooMethod -> fooMethod

	* optimized src/Objects: now few hundred times faster than earlier

2000-11-17  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Removed .cc files

2000-11-09  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Renamed all cc files to cpp for Visual studio. Old .cc files still
	  remain. Will be removed once we are sure this is stable.
	
2000-11-01  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed negotiation so it is now possible for packed to get picked.
	  (Packed decoder appears to segfault though)
