	* Fixed an error in the README

Saturday, December 29, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* Wrote some documentation, cleaned up the little that was
	  already there.

Saturday, December 29, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* Removed some unnecessary template specifications, changed
	  Vector<len> to Vector<dim> and RotMatrix<size> to RotMatrix<dim>
	  for cross class consistency in the name of the template parameter
	* Removed the base Shape<> class, leaving a bunch of simple classes
	  for basic shapes which possess a common interface
	* Changed test code to use toString() method directly rather than
	  through operator<<()
	* Changed ToAtlas() and FromAtlas() to use toString() and fromString(),
	  eliminating the need for a separately compiled atlas conversion
	  library
	* Added the shape interface functions to Point<>
	* Replaced the symlinks to COPYING and INSTALL files added by automake
	  with the files themselves. This should hopefully let me get them
	  into CVS.
	* More work on intersection functions

Tuesday, December 18, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* Some cleanup on RotMatrix<>::setVals() backend, Atlas conversion
	  functions
	* Added Ball<>, Segment<>, RotBox<> classes (not all RotBox<>
	  intersection functions written yet)

Monday, December 17, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* Wrote Shape<> base class
	* Wrote AxisBox<> class
	* Cleaned up header file naming convention, so foo_funcs.h is
	  always the function templates for the class in foo.h

Friday, December 14, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* .cvsignore fixes
	* Rearranged the ordering of function declarations in the
	  classes in an attempt at a cross-class standard, added
	  some bits I'd missed
	* Added polar, spherical coordinate conversions to Point<> and Vector<>

Thursday, December 13, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* Added setVals() method to Matrix<>
	* Added operator>> for Vector<>, Matrix<>, Point<> to give
	  string read capability, added stream_funcs.cpp
	* Added toString() and fromString() for Vector<>, Matrix<>, Point<>,
	  changed operator<< to use toString(), removed operator>>

Wednesday, December 12, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* Created atlas_funcs.cpp, wrote GetAtlasDoubleList() and
	  SetAtlasDoubleList() to handle most of the Atlas
	  interface work
	* Got a test for Atlas into configure.in
	* First CVS upload
`	* Copied the CoalCoord class in as Point<>, moved CoordType
	  and IsFloatEqual() into const.h, const.cpp
	* Added FloatAdd() and FloatSubtract() to handle numbers
	  whose sum/difference is (nearly) zero
	* Modified Vector<> and Matrix<> to use CoordType

Tuesday, December 11, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* Got test functions working with RotMatrix<>
	* Created atlas_funcs.h to hold Atlas interface code,
	  wrote ToAtlas() and FromAtlas() for Vector<> and
	  Matrix<>

Monday, December 10, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* After coversation with Rakshasa about how matrices are actually
	  being used in stage, replaced Matrix<> with RotMatrix<>


Friday, December 7, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* Created some tests in matrix_test
	* Added GPL information to all the source files

Thursday, December 6, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* Added more tests to vector_test
	* Implemented sloppyMag and associated functions
	  for Vector<2>, Vector<3>
	* Added a script, bc_sloppy_mag_3, to calculate some constants
	  for the Vector<3> implementation of sloppyMag
	* Got rid of RowVector<> and ColumnVector<> classes,
	  added rowSet() and columnSet() to Matrix<>

Wednesday, December 5, 2001	Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>

	* First ChangeLog entry
	* Autoconf is working, and the Vector<> and Matrix<> class compile
	* Got the README, AUTHORS, and TODO files written
	* Changed #include "foo.h" to #include <wfmath/foo.h> in
	  the header files
	* Added const.h
	* Created vector_test.cpp, matrix_test.cpp, started work on
	  vector_test
