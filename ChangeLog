	* Fixed up dispatcher tree some more (sights encap imags), seems
	  to work with Stage, and Stage works with Process. This is
	  tenuous validation at best, but it will do. Testing with
	  cyphesis appreciated.

	* Added ArgumentDispatcher (map args only,  list args are easy too add too).
	  This is required to route based upon args[loc=ID] in the new OOG
	  format we are switching too.
	* Rebuilt the Room and Lobby OOG routing code for sight / sound / imaginary
	  apperance / disappearance. The code has been flipped; Lobby sets up 
	  global class selectors for each op, and rooms insert ArgDispatch
	  children below these to examine the 'loc' attribute.
	* This needs some testing and verification, but I can't right now so
	  comitting and hoping.

	* Support deffered binding of containers in Entity::recvSight,
	  using the same policy as 'set' uses; i.e creating a secondary
	  Set operation and deffering it until after the container is
	  loaded.
	* Check for empty location attributes in Entity::recvSight, which
	  can happen with root / world objects.
	* Changed various instances of GetAttr("foo").AsXXX to GetFoo() where
	  I'd forgotten / didn't know a Foo accessor existed; thanks to
	  alriddoch for catching these.
	* Fix emission of World.Entered signal until both the root entity and
	  character entity are valid.
	* throw an InvalidOperation exception if getRootEntity is called
	  prior to World.Entered being emitted.

	* Changed inheritance of BaseException; now inherits from std::runtime_error,
	  and correctly forwards the error string. As a result, exception.what() will
	  return a sensible value. Thanks to Karsten Laux for the suggestion.
	  
	* Applied Karsten's re-ordering in World::World() (store the instance pointer
	  before creating the default entity). I have no idea why this  went
	  un-noticed in testing, very strange.
	* Added an id member to BaseConnection, to help discriminate connections and
	  their timeouts. This is important if you're connecting to a server while
	  the Meta code is querying it : things get confused!. Thanks to Karsten for
	  the catch on this one.

	* Correclty process the location / contains
	  attributes to construct the IG entity tree

Monday, September 10 2001, James Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>
	* Handle both 'account' and 'player' entites in Lobby;
	  necessary until proper client-side Atlas type handling
	  is available.
	* Configuration changes to lay ground work for Python
	  bingings - talk to me if you want to help / test

Wednesday, August 29 2001, James Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>

	* Fixed disconnection (actually call _stream->close())
	  and hence reconnection - rejoice!
	* Added a simple logging system using va_args and a
	  signal on Connection (Log). Seems to work, and doesn't mess up
	  ncurses like simply using 'cout' does. Wish I'd done this ages
	  ago, took about 5 minutes <sigh>.

Tuesday, August 28 2001, James Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>

	* Added #include "ServerInfo.h" to Metaserver.h so people don't
	  get hit with a huge raft of STL errors if they forget to include
	  it themselves.
	* Added timeouts to Metaserver and hooked up MetaQuery timeouts
	* Fixed various disconnect / reconnect bugs
	* Player now hooks Connection::Disconnecting to issue a logout
	  operation. Currently the reply is undefined so this will always
	  hit the disconnect timeout.
	* Disconnect is still not working quite right.

Monday, August 27 2001, Jmaes Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>

	* Add timeouts to BaseConnection / Connection, and
	  exposed in a relatively sane way.
	* Modifed Time.h/.cpp to be more portable, and
	  updated the timing code in Meta that used it.
	* Made Connection::disconnect actually do something. This entailed
	  adding status locking to the connection =>
	* Added lock() / unlock() calls to Connection; these can hold the
	  Connection in a state (currently only DISCONNECTING) while
	  users of the connection perform tasks. Needs testing of
	  course, but I think the principle is sound.
	
Sunday, August 19 2001, James Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>

	* Added support for emotes to OOG session
	* New TypeInfo system (not tested yet)
	* Re-wrote the Connection dispatch model to handle 
	  re-dispathces more flexibly.
	* Added a zero-argument SignalDispatcher
	* Fixed Room Talk and Emote signals to send the
	  account ID, instead of the user's name.

Friday, August 10 2001, James Turner <jmtn@blueyonder.co.uk>

	* Updated README and INSTALL to contains something
	  vaugely informative.
	* Initial work on TypeInfo.cpp/.h classes (not part)
	  of build at present.
	* Entity factories are sorted by a priority now. This
	  meant using a multimap internally, though I've just
	  realised a multi-set would be sufficent. D'oh.

Saturday, August 04 2001, James Turner

	* Handle sparse rooms without throwing an exceptions;
	  checks that the 'people' and 'rooms' list exist
	  before attempting to extract them.
	* Fixed file line endings

Sunday, July 29 2001, James Turner

	* Added redispatch (re-post) support; needs testing
	  and documentation but the basics are there and
	  quite clean.
	* Added RecapDsiaptcher and IdDispatcher
	* Instance() singleton accessor on Eris::Connection
	* Sythetic appearance generation as required
	* Fixed dispatcher setup for sound(talk)
	* In-game works, with some bug (5 copies of messages!)

Friday, July 27 2001, James Turner

	* Renamed methods to leadingLowerCase style, as requested
	  by Al Riddoch.
	* Added std:: prefix to lots of things to make GCC 3.0
	  happier. Doubtless some remain.
	* Fixed context dispatch stack handling when backtracking
	  occurs (wasn't correclty popping encapsulated objects)

Thursday, July 26 2001, James Turner

	* Added Meta-server status codes
	* Added 'Failure' signal to Meta
	* Much improved meta-server error handling in general

Wednesday, July 25 2001, James Turner

	* Changed Dispatcher interface to support passing
 	  multiple objects down the tree. This enables 'context'
	  to be maintained, i.e encapsualting objects are not
	  discarded.
	* Added SignalDispatcher2, which binds to both the curent
	  top of the context stack, and it's parent. In theorey,
	  SignalDispatcher3/4 etc could be provided, but this is
	  unlikely to occurr much in practice.
	* Bumped version to 0.1.3
	* Handle Stage RIM Chat bug where ID of certain objects 
	  is not set in SIGHTs (use TO attribute of SIGHT op)

Sunday, July 22 2001, James Turner

	* Fixed player to correctly register 'LoggedIn' signal
	  on Lobby, which was getting ignored.
	* Implemented Connection::RemoveDispatcherByPath

Saturday, July 21 2001, James Turner

	* Fixed Lobby::Join to match silence-py behaviour
	* Added 'Leave' (part) operation to Room, and made the
	  destructor call it when appropriate.
	* Hacking charatcer creation, still being strange

Sunday, July 15 2001, James Turner

	* Meta-server code now seems to work, but:
	* Rebuilt the query code to build and return ServerInfo objects
	* Handle Cyphesis-style anonymous GET replies (no refno set)

Wednesday, July 04 2001, James Turner

	* More reconnection work
	* Correctly handle NULL stamps (assume unstamped)
	* Bumped version to 0.1.2

Tuesday, July 03 2001, James Turner

	* Added reconnection support to Connection
	* Changes to World to support reconnection
	* Correctly validate the entity stamp when processing
		APPEARANCE ops.
	* Added GetStamp() accessor to Entity
	* Set serial number on most out-going ops	

Monday, July 02 2001, James Turner

	* Added meta-system; needs some work

Wednesday, June 27 2001, James Turner
	
	* Re-factored connection into an underlying layer (BasicConnection)
	and a public wrapper (Connection); this is to permit Meta-system
	queries using a light-weight connection system.
	* Add Appear / Disappear / Entered signals to World

Tuesday, June 26 2001, James Turner

	* Updated configure.in to test for skstream header / library
	* Updated configure.in to test for Atlas headers and libraries
	* OOG System appears to be working with preliminary code in Stage
	* Appear / Disappear handled correctly
	* Generates correct OOG Talk ops
	* Preliminary support for IG operation

Created initial change-log becuase automake requires it
