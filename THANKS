The design of Atlas-C++ is based partially on a prototype version created by
John Barrett <jbarrett@box100.com>.

Thanks also go to:

Alistair Riddoch <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk> for his help wrangling with C++ socket
libraries, giving constant feedback and generally being cool.

Aloril <aloril@iki.fi> for his constant support in answering never-ending
Atlas questions. You're The Man.

All the others who have provided help and feedback during this library's
development, including much thanks to our fearless (and patient) leader
Bryce Harrington <bryce@neptune.net>.
