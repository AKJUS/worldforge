    <h1>WorldForge Protocol requirements (revision #8)</h1>

<pre>
 - The protocol must be capable of:

    - transmitting objects
    - transmitting changes or additions to objects

    (For the purposes of this document, an "object" will be taken to be a
    bundle of properties. A property is a named or anonymous chunk of data,
    in one of the "atomic types" of the protocol. Supported types of
    properties should be described in the protocol specification. Two types
    are mandated: objects must be able to contain sub-objects, and objects
    must be able to contain some form of id or reference to other objects.
    Basic types such as ints, strings and lists are of course highly
    recommended if the protocol is to be at all useful). 

 - The protocol must be capable of describing such scenarios as:

    - movement of things in a game world
    - combat between things in a game world
    - acquisition of things by other things in a game world

    (For the purposes of this document, a "thing in a game world" will be 
    taken to mean exactly what it says. Sample things include pens, swords,
    raging oceans and small furry animals. These things may be stored in 
    completely arbitrary fashion on a client or server, thus the protocol
    must be capable of describing the above scenarios without making
    assumptions concerning entity representation).

 - The protocol must also be capable of handling situations involving:

    - login negotiation between clients and servers, including authentication
    - access control to update, create or destroy particular objects

 - The protocol must be independent of:

    - application layer (the application using it, the calling program),
      for example: backstage, cyphesis, uclient, anvil...
	  
    - session layer (syntax, format, representation, what it looks like),
      for example: XML, or packed binary, or gzip compressed lisp expressions.

    - transport layer (the mechanism for getting it to places),
      for example: TCP or UDP sockets, saving to a file, IPX, and so on.

 - To be accepted however, a protocol needs to be demonstrated using one or
   more actual session layers (syntaxes, formats...) that can represent:

    - all the necessary semantics of the protocol
    - 20 things in a game world becoming visible in at most 3860 bytes
    - 20 things in a game world changing direction in at most 3860 bytes

    (Note, the precise bandwidth numbers come from the STAGE requirements,
    involving a certain number of clients on a server with a T1 line. It
    can be assumed that all other servers will have similar if not more 
    stringent ones. The target is not hard to meet, it is just there to 
    impose a limit on any delusions of bandwidth grandeur a protocol
    designer may be experiencing).

 - These session layers must be defined completely in an appropriate way,
   for instance a DTD for an XML based syntax, or detailed descriptions of
   chunks for a packed binary format. Binary formats must also specify
   either an endianess convention or a way to detect it at run-time. ASCII
   formats must specify if they use alternative character sets or encodings
   rather than pure ASCII.

 - Although working code is not a pre-requisite for protocol acceptance, it
   must be possible for an implementation of the protocol to be written in
   any sane language, using sane libraries. No esoteric languages features
   or unusual libraries must be required. The protocol API (the presentation
   layer) as presented to an application must be simple and easy to use, for
   both emitting and receiving.
