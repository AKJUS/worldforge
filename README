varconf

Varconf is configuration library.  It handles storing of configuration information, as well as parsing of config files, command-line input and environment variables. 

PREREQUISITES

To compile varconf, you must first compile and install the Atlas library.  See the Atlas README file for details.

NOTES

Varconf is a work in progress.  Expect features to be added, changed or removed.  Also, while this author will do his best to avoid serious bugs and errors, I provide no warranty in the event of an international disaster or other such problems caused from the use of this library.
