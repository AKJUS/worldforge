This is the Worldforge math library. It's licensed under the LGPL
(see file COPYING), and basic compilation instructions are in
the file INSTALL. The current maintainer is Ron Steinke
<rsteinke@w-link.net>.

The header wfmath/wfmath.h includes everything except for
operator<<() for the various classes. These functions are defined
in wfmath/stream_funcs.h.

The Vector<> and Matrix<> classes (currently) have no virtual destructors.
This makes computations faster, as there's one less function to call
for each intermediate value. It does mean, however, that you have to be
careful with derived classes.
