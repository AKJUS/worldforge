Atlas-C++

Welcome to Atlas-C++, the C++ reference implementation of the Atlas protocol.

This library implements the Atlas protocol, for use in client-server
game applications.  This library is suitable for linking to either
clients or servers.

Short instructions:
1) ./autgen.sh
2) ./configure
3) cd src
4) make
5) as root: make install
6) cd ..
7) make
step 7 only needed if want to compile: tutorial
8) make check
step 8 only needed if want to compile and run: tests and benchmark

In order to generate the documentation, you will need doxygen.

SOCKET LIBRARIES

Atlas-C++ relies on iostreams being used as socket streams for network
communications. This means you will need to either use an existing library
or use your own.

One such a library is libsocket++, which you can download at:

ftp://ftp.umsicht.fhg.de/pub/unix/language/C++/class-libraries/socket++-1.10.tar.gz

For a version that compiles in recent Linux versions:

http://3.141593.org/source/socket++-1.10-wf1.tar.gz

If you are using FreeBSD, please use the version in /usr/ports/net/.

We have not had the chance to test this in windows yet.

DOCUMENTATION

To generate the documentation, simply configure the tree, then in Atlas-C++/
type "make docs". This will use doxygen to generate the documentation, which
will then reside in Atlas-C++/doc/.
