 MetaServer Overview
 -------------------
 The MetaServer Next Generation is a generic lobby type server.  The main services that it provides are:
 1. Maintain a list of currently available servers, and their details.
 2. Provide mechanism for servers to update, and clients to query this
    information.
 3. Provide delegate authentication, if requested by the connecting server.
 4. 
 
 MetaServer Configuration
 ------------------------
 [sections] - high level organisation of configuration options
 key=value  - specific option

 Unknown options in the configuration file are ignored, and 
 incorrectly formatted values raise a fatal exception on startup.

 In the case of a mismatch, the metaserver-ng.conf file contains
 the authoratative list of default values, and running the metaserver
 with the "--help" option will display the authoratative list of 
 accepted options.

 The majority of options are self explanitory.  Some options will be
 given a description as the purpose may be unclear.
