<p><c props="lang:en-GB"></c>Eris, the WorldForge client entity library</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eris is designed to simplify client development (and avoid repeating the</p>
<p>same work several times), by providing a common system to deal with the</p>
<p>back end tasks. Notably, Eris encapsulates most of the work in getting</p>
<p>Atlas entities available on your client, logging into a server, and</p>
<p>managing updates from the server. Thus it can be considered as a session</p>
<p>layer above Atlas, providing persistent (for the session) objects as</p>
<p>opposed to Atlas ones (which are transient). It handles the client-side</p>
<p>implementation of the meta-server protocol, and querying game servers;</p>
<p>out-of-game (OOG) operations (via the Lobby and Rooms), and most</p>
<p>important in-game (IG) operations such as entity creation, movement and</p>
<p>updates.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eris provides a generic 'Entity' class, which you are free to sub-class</p>
<p>and provide to the system (by registering a factory with the World);</p>
<p>thus you are free to create different classes to handle characters,</p>
<p>walls, vehicles, etc as your client dictates. An alternative approach is</p>
<p>to simply create peer classes, and connect them to Eris via</p>
<p>callbacks. Eris makes extensive use of libSigC++, which must be</p>
<p>correctly installed and functioning on your system. Familiarity with</p>
<p>signal/slot programming concepts is essential for using Eris; the</p>
<p>libSigC++ home-page has some examples. Gtk+ or QT signal systems also</p>
<p>provide a good introduction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that Eris does NOT encapsulate Atlas for you! Your code must still</p>
<p>perform the useful work, such as generating operations, and analyzing</p>
<p>attributes. Eris simply makes getting this information much easier. Also,</p>
<p>an understanding of the Atlas Objects specification, and how it is</p>
<p>applied in practice will make working with Eris much easier. Eris does</p>
<p>permit you to ignore lower-level Atlas issues such as Codecs and</p>
<p>connections (if you choose too).</p>
<p></p>
<p>For examples of using Eris, see 'silence' in forge/clients/silence; this</p>
<p>is a simple NCurses / Gtkl based text client that demonstrates how to use</p>
<p>Eris. For larger, graphical examples see apogee or dime, both in</p>
<p>forge/clients/. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The INSTALL document tells you how to compile Eris; note that if you</p>
<p>plan on distributing binaries of a client compiled with Eris, you may</p>
<p>wish to consider statically linking.  As the Linux C++ ABI improves this</p>
<p>may become less critical, but at present even minor difference in</p>
<p>compiler and library versions can produce strange errors at runtime.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, Eris is a very open system; if you have an entity utility,</p>
<p>processing method or other concept you think is reusable in many</p>
<p>WorldForge clients, please let me (James Turner) know about it for</p>
<p>possible inclusion.</p>
