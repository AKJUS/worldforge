Eris 1.3.7 has been released, with many bugs discovered at LinuxTag 2005 fixed.
This release also includes updates to the unit-test harness, which now uses
Unix pipes instead of socket-pairs for out-of-band control.

Hagen has further improved the output of the metaQuery tool, to display server
uptime in a human-meaningful way, and this version is now in use on the
'Active Servers' section of the website.

This is a development release, as the API will change prior to the final
release of Eris 1.4.0. However, any changes should be minor and easy to
incorporate into clients - testing is recommended and appreciated.

This is the fourth unstable release of Eris 1.3, which will become Eris 1.4 in
the distant future. In this release, various API improvements have taken
place - the current server can be queried for it's information easily, the
lifetime of Eris::Connection has been made explicit, and other minor changes.

Internally, some of the complex router logic has been replaced with a new
Responder system which handles most operations that naturally fit a request /
respone idiom. The tests cases have been extended, and should now work reliably
on all platforms, and many bugs have been fixed.

As with previous 1.3 releases, the API is not yet frozen, with some minor
changes planned after this release. All such changes should be minor and
localised. Feedback on the API, feature requests and bug reports are all
welcomed.

2005-01-08

This is the second unstable release of the current development work that will
become Eris 1.4. A large number of bugs have been fixed since the previous
release, in all areas of the code. The API has evolved slightly, so that
more failures can be reported to the client application (for example, failure
to create a character).

More methods have been made virtual, at the suggestion of client-developers,
and the arguments to many signals had been reduced and simplified, since there
was a great deal of redundancy previously.

While the API is settling down, it is still likely to change before the stable
release, and should not be considered frozen. However, any changes should
be incremental and localised.

2004-10-19

This is a development release of what will become Eris 1.4, the next stable
version of Eris. Changes include Atlas-C++ 0.6 support, a re-written
internal message routing structure, and the re-factoring of the public API
based on experiences with Eris 1.2. SigC++ 2.0 is now optionally supported;
if it is available when Eris is configured, it will be picked over 1.2.

For a detailed description of these changes, see the accompanying
CHANGES-1.4 file, which includes help on migrating to the new API.

Please note the API for this release is still evolving based on feedback
(which is welcomed, see the AUTHORS file for contact info). The API WILL
change prior to the 1.4 release.
