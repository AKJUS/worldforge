This is the second unstable release of the current development work that will
become Eris 1.4. A large number of bugs have been fixed since the previous
release, in all areas of the code. The API has evolved slightly, so that
more failures can be reported to the client application (for example, failure
to create a character).

More methods have been made virtual, at the suggestion of client-developers,
and the arguments to many signals had been reduced and simplified, since there
was a great deal of redundancy previously.

While the API is settling down, it is still likely to change before the stable
release, and should not be considered frozen. However, any changes should
be incremental and localised.

This is a development release of what will become Eris 1.4, the next stable
version of Eris. Changes include Atlas-C++ 0.6 support, a re-written
internal message routing structure, and the re-factoring of the public API
based on experiences with Eris 1.2. SigC++ 2.0 is now optionally supported;
if it is available when Eris is configured, it will be picked over 1.2.

For a detailed description of these changes, see the accompanying
CHANGES-1.4 file, which includes help on migrating to the new API.

Please note the API for this release is still evolving based on feedback
(which is welcomed, see the AUTHORS file for contact info). The API WILL
change prior to the 1.4 release.
