This is a development release of what will become Eris 1.4, the next stable
version of Eris. Changes include Atlas-C++ 0.6 support, a re-written
internal message routing structure, and the re-factoring of the public API
based on experiences with Eris 1.2. SigC++ 2.0 is now optionally supported;
if it is available when Eris is configured, it will be picked over 1.2.

Please note the API for this release is still evolving based on feedback
(which is welcomed, see the AUTHORS file for contact info). The API WILL
change prior to the 1.4 release.
