test cases

 check for an anonymous OOG look on login, send empty lobby
 check for OOG entry
 
 repeat, but with one other account, then two
 
 check for sight person returning correct values
 
 check that SightPerson signal fires when the new people log in,
 and also when they go away
 
 check chat is recived okay
 ditto for emotes
 
 private chat, check it's okay

------------------------
 
 
 ---- movement ---------
 
 	prediction ? risky.
 
 ----- batched appearance ------
 
 	toggle option for batching on agent, and re-run test?
 	yes, that's a good idea.
