Goals are defined in the “_goals” property, as a list of maps.

Format:


```
_goals: [{
	name: 'Feed'
	sub_goals: [


]
class: 'Search',
params: {
	what: 'entity instance_of types.bread'
}

]
```



## Entity relationships

Every mind relates to all other entities through both “disposition” and “threat”.

The disposition determines whether the entity is a friend or foe. 0 means neutral, 1.0 is a “friend”, -1.0 is a “foe”.

How to handle “foes” is determined by the “threat”. If it’s 1.0 the mind should flee, if it’s -1.0 the mind should attack.
