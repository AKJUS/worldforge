The episode4 configuration format

DEFINITIONS

The configuration is a database that consists of sections.

Sections contain configuration items and each section has a section identifier.

A section identifier is a lower case name, consisting of the characters
'a'-'z', '0'-'9', '-' and '_'.

A configuration item consists of a name and a value.

A configuration item name is a lower-case identifier, consisting of the
characters 'a'-'z', '0'-'9', '-' and '_'.

A configuration item value is a piece of information stored internally as a
string value that may be represented as at least one of the configuration
types.

The configuration types include
 - boolean, i.e. 2 possible values, either true or false
 - integer, i.e. a positive or negative whole number
 - double, i.e. a double-precision positive or negative real number
 - string, i.e. a free-form string of characters including all characters in
   the ASCII character set from characters 32-255

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

A line in a configuration file can either be the start of a section, a
configuration item or a comment.

\n denotes the end of a line or the end of the file
{ws} denotes any (0 or more) amount of whitespace
{nm} denotes a name consisting of a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' or '-'
{ac} denotes any character other than '"'
{cm} denotes any character other than \n

Syntax for section start:

{ws}[{nm}]{ws}\n

Syntax for configuration item:

{ws}{nm}{ws}={ws}{nm{ws}\n
  or
{ws}{nm}{ws}={ws}"{ac}"{ws}\n

Syntax for comment:

{ws}#{cm}\n

Note that upper case characters (A-Z) in configuration item names and section
names get converted to their lower case equivalents (a-z) automatically.

A configuration item may be followed by a comment.

Empty lines (lines with 0 or more whitespaces and no other characters) are
ignored.
