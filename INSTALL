You need to have Atlas-C++, skstream and libsigc++ to build Eris. In addition it is assumed you have an up-to-date C++ compiler and STL implementation (GCC 2.95 is the lowest tested version, 2.91 will probably not work).

Atlas-C++ and skstream are both found in forge/libs/ from WorldForge CVS; compile and install them before you try to build Eris. Take note of where you install them too (/usr/local by default), since you may need to pass this prefix to 'aclocal'.

libsigc++ is included in all common distributions; if you have Gnome 1.2 or higher installed, you certainly have it. Verify that you also have the development packages installed. Otherwise get the library in your preferred format from:
	
	 http://libsigc.sourceforge.net/

Once these pre-requisites are satisfied, you can proceed with compiling Eris. The supplied 'auotgen.sh' will setup 'configure' for you (in the case of CVS versions), but it is possible you will need to run 'aclocal' manually passing in '-I /prefix/to/atlas/share/aclocal'. So if you installed Atlas-C++ to '/opt/forge', you need to run aclocal like this:

forge/libs/eris: aclocal -I /opt/forge/share/aclocal

If running this command produces errors about undefined macros (AM_PATH_ATLAS or AM_PATH_SIGC), then you need to add '-I' options until aclocal can find the .m4 files created by libSigc++ and Atlas-C++.

Once this is done, run configure. At present there are no special arguments, but verify everything goes okay. If you get errors about libraries not being found, and you believe they are installed, do NOT hack around the problem in configure. Verify that you have the correct development packages installed, that the relevant -config programs (atlas-config and sigc-config) are in your path, and that aclocal found all the macros it needs. 

Assuming configure is sucessful, simply 'make' and 'make install'. That's it.

If you have Doxygen installed, executing 'make doc' will build the documentation; at present only HTML is built. Edit eris.dox to change the output formats / styles.
