Shapes left to do:
	Polygon (2D only)
	Simplex<> (triangle in 2D, tetrahedron in 3D, etc.)
	RotBox<> (like the Volume class in stage/math)
Check stage/math and libCoal for any leftover math bits which haven't
	gotten included yet
Improve efficiency of toString()/fromString() backend
Rearrange the functions in foo_funcs.h to match the order in the class
	in foo.h
