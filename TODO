Eris TODO

Optimisations

 - replace a call to map::count followed by map::operation[] with a call to
   find, as its twice as efficient.
- in entity attribute handling, hash the attr name to a compile-time index,
 so nativeAttrChanged can use a single switch statement
 
BUGS

 - addAncestor() gets into a tight loop which suggests that a type lists itself
   as a child. We need to be invulnerable to this.

 - entity sight(create) path shouldn't mark things visible. Need to track
   newly created entities to regulate EntityCreated signal emission.

Test Cases

- hear on Avatar
- Avatar::place
- picking

- simulate a server shutdown (call shutdown() on the client socket)

- cycle character through create, unsubscribe and re-take on a single
  account (needs unsubscribe behaviour to speced and implemented)

1.3 TODO

- room creation / binding
  room creation seems okay, the only reason for the pending crap is so
  we can hold the Room object around.
  
  map<serialno, Room*> m_pendingSightCreates on lobby makes this work.
  yech.

- Go over the Poll api, see if work can be delegated to skstream or not

- Deal with Unseen errors, by deleting the affected entity. Note this
  may cause invalidation fun for clients.
     
 - custom routers
 	- run first, but can't consume ops
 	- attached on Connection, or on the 'owning' router?
 	- Conenction seems more robust. re-structure how routers are tracked,
 	  possibly?

- Avatar unsubscribe!

Longer Term TODO

- UI backend stuff
