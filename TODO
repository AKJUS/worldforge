Shapes left to do:
	Polygon (2D only)
	Simplex<> (triangle in 2D, tetrahedron in 3D, etc.)
Check stage/math and libCoal for any leftover math bits which haven't
	gotten included yet; the only things left appear to be
	CoalPolygonShape and a possible union-of-spheres function
	for Ball<> suggested by math_vector.h in stage/math
Replace double with CoordType everywhere
Write an API reference for the library. Find some inline documentation tool?
Rearrange the functions in foo_funcs.h to match the order in the class
	in foo.h
