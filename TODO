Finish Vector<> and Matrix<> classes
Add a Point<> class
Include orientation() operators for Vector<> once we have polar,
	spherical points defined
Stick Euler angle, orientation() stuff for Matrix<> into
	a RotMatrix<> class, which is limited to rotation matrices?
Add a Shape class, and child classes which include everything
	in shape.h from libCoal, and axisalignedbox.h, math_volume.h,
	and volume.h from stage/math
Check stage/math and libCoal for any leftover math bits which haven't
	gotten included yet
