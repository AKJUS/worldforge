Eris TODO

Clean up the exception heriarchy
	- really fatal stuff (Eris::Fatal)
	- runtime failure (Eris::Runtime)
	- network / connection failure 
		? signals !?
		
	- Atlas spec failure (Eris::Illegal)
	
Support admin accounts?	

Handle network disconnects and reconnects better
Timeouts on all Atlas ops (and heart-beats)

Correctly allow externally driven socket notifications (e.g
from Gtk+ socket callbacks); this is platform specific
and must be #ifdef-ed of course

Handle the 'uptime' attribute of 'Server' objects (the thing returned by anonymous GETs on game servers); need to find out format (string / int) and scale.
