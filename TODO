Shapes left to do:
	Polygon (2D only)
	Simplex<> (triangle in 2D, tetrahedron in 3D, etc.)
	RotBox<> (like the Volume class in stage/math)
Check stage/math and libCoal for any leftover math bits which haven't
	gotten included yet
Improve efficiency of toString()/fromString() backend
Rearrange the functions in foo_funcs.h to match the order in the class
	in foo.h

Does putting operator<<() in stream.h to avoid including <iostream> really
	help when <string> is being included everywhere? Is there some way
	to work around this, but still preserve the toString()/fromString()
	member functions in every class?
