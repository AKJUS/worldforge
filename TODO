Intersect functions unimplemented for dim != 2,3 (extremely low priority):
	Intersect(Polygon<>, AxisBox<>, bool)
	Intersect(Polygon<>, RotBox<>, bool)
	Intersect(RotBox<>, AxisBox<>, bool)
	Intersect(RotBox<>, RotBox<>, bool)
    These will be postponed until I can think of a way to write them,
    or someone needs them, whichever comes first
Add shape tests from COAL
Write rotateInverse() functions
Redo Euler angle stuff
Look into whether miniball code can handle using float instead of double;
	if so, replace Wrapped_array with Point
Requests from Jesse: NAN, INFINITY, RADIANS_TO_DEGREES, DEGREES_TO_RADIANS
Write an API reference for the library. Find some inline documentation tool?
Deal with difficulties in making certain functions friends of the
	appropriate classes
Rearrange the functions in foo_funcs.h to match the order in the class
	in foo.h

Schedule:
0.2.7	- official tarball release, mostly so man-di can roll a .deb
0.2.8	- add the _valid flag alriddoch requested, code review up
	  through AxisBox and Ball
0.2.9	- code review for everything but Polygon
0.3.0	- finish Polygon, code review. Remove old Intersect()/IntersectProper()
	  interface
