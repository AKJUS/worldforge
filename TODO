Eris TODO

addAncestor() gets into a tight loop which suggests that a type lists itself
as a child. We need to be invulnerable to this.

View may need to be created earlier, as I may need to connect to its signals.
If I can't do this until Avatar::InGame is fired, then I may miss some
entities on View::EntityCreated.

1.2 TODO

- room creation / binding
  room creation seems okay, the only reason for the pending crap is so
  we can hold the Room object around.
  
  map<serialno, Room*> m_pendingSightCreates on lobby makes this work.
  yech.
  
- rename Player to Account

- Go over the Poll api, see if work can be delegated to skstream or not

- go over and clean up the metaquery code, it's horrible, especially the
  snprint stuff.
- update metaserver to API agreed with Al
- add world time support to igRouter / Avatar

- Talk handlers (and others) on the recipient, i.e a Hear(const Sound&) on Avatar

Longer Term TODO

- motion prediction, nicked from Sear
- UI backend stuff
