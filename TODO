Rearrange the functions in foo_funcs.h to match the order in the class
	in foo.h
Add a Shape class, and child classes which include everything
	in shape.h from libCoal, and axisalignedbox.h, math_volume.h,
	and volume.h from stage/math
Check stage/math and libCoal for any leftover math bits which haven't
	gotten included yet
