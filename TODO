Eris TODO

1.2 TODO

- migrate to Atlas 0.6 API
- make Avatar storage map on world, remove the bizzare global map. 
- remove all the global accessors (Instance()) and friends, and properly
  sort out the ownership relations
  
  Connection owns a type service
  
  World owns Avatars, Entities
  Lobby owns Rooms and OOG person objects
  
  Player (maybe this shoukd be renamed to Account?)
  
  Account could potentially own a connection, lobby and world. Depends
  how we assume re-use. At the moment, Lobby and World are both bound to a
  single account.
  
- use routers generally. Connection is the routing base, with an anonymous
  router (almost certainly the account), and various routers bound to
  TO (one for oog account, going to the lobby, and one for each Avatar, all
  forward to World, except for any avatar specific stuff)
  
- Anoymous router on Account hence handles all the activation INFO edge cases,
  also needs to forward tpye service onwards. And logout, and maybe
  INFO(LOGOUT)

Longer Term TODO

- motion prediction, nicked from Sear
- UI backend stuff
