Eris TODO

addAncestor() gets into a tight loop which suggests that a type lists itself
as a child. We need to be invulnerable to this.

1.3 TODO

- room creation / binding
  room creation seems okay, the only reason for the pending crap is so
  we can hold the Room object around.
  
  map<serialno, Room*> m_pendingSightCreates on lobby makes this work.
  yech.

- add more helpers for common client actions on Avatar. For example
  use and emote, to go with say and touch.  

- Go over the Poll api, see if work can be delegated to skstream or not

- add world time support to igRouter / Avatar

- Talk handlers (and others) on the recipient, i.e a Hear(const Sound&) on Avatar

Longer Term TODO

- motion prediction, nicked from Sear
- UI backend stuff
