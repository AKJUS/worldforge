New TODO by Al Riddoch

Items below are probably still valid, but this is where i reconsider the
order and priority of tasks, and make my own notes.

Generally speaking it seems having virtual methods with the same names
is not all that good a trick. It causes methods to get hidden when only
some are overridden in a subclass.

Add cout operators for Message::Object at least. Its a pain having to mess about
with them.

TODO list for Atlas-C++:

Items are written up by those who they are assigned to, unless otherwise noted
