New TODO by Al Riddoch

Items below are probably still valid, but this is where i reconsider the
order and priority of tasks, and make my own notes.

Make the code for adding new decoder methods templaty so we can ovoid nasty casting.

Generally speaking it seems having virtual methods with the same names
is not all that good a trick. It causes methods to get hidden when only
some are overridden in a subclass.

Write codecs, connectors and acceptors for datagram based communication,
specialising Codec<> template using an abstract datagram class interface.

Talk about a non-smartpointer based objects API, as I am not comfortable
coding with the automatic one. The API should be somewhat similar to
the 0.4 API, but should not require the dumb instantiate() arse, and
should provide a virtual clone() method.

Write acceptor/negotiator for file based atlas, to load from a file
of unknown codec.

Modify the objects API so we can track which attributes have been set, rather
than relying on their value. Then we can get orientation, and perhaps even
bbox into the spec, and support that well.

Add cout operators for Message::Object at least. Its a pain having to mess about
with them.

TODO list for Atlas-C++:

Items are written up by those who they are assigned to, unless otherwise noted
(using " -- ").

TODO in the 0.5 devel series

 - ensure that the Objects code uses member construction efficiently, as
     was done in 0.4.2

 - Make sure exceptions inherit from std::exception

 - Stop passing Objects when Object::MapType is the only option

TODO items for anybody who wants to do them:

 - add input filtering to Atlas::filterbuf -- sdt
 - make use of Atlas::filterbuf -- sdt
     look for XXX in src/Net/Stream.cpp -- sdt
 - finish tutorial -- sdt
 - rewrite negotiate [0.3.[9|10] / 0.4.0 ] -- sdt
 - add docs to: [0.4.0]
    * Atlas::Net::Stream[Accept|Connect]
     -- sdt
 - write tests/ [0.4.0 / 0.3.10] -- sdt
 - make all tests succeed [0.4.0] -- sdt
 - make use of metrics in negotiation and elsewhere -- sdt [0.4.x]

Notes:

Stefanus Du Toit is no longer participating largely.
Michael Day is no longer participating largely.
Al Riddoch has now taken over ownership this code.
