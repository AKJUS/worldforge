Eris TODO

Clean up the exception heriarchy
	- really fatal stuff (Eris::Fatal)
	- runtime failure (Eris::Runtime)
	- network / connection failure 
		? signals !?
		
	- Atlas spec failure (Eris::Illegal)
	
Support admin accounts? If requested, not especially difficult but extends beyond the current scope.

Handle network disconnects and reconnects better (the code is there, but hasn?t been extensively tested). In theory, re-connection to in-game worlds should function, but stamp validity and such things needs to be checked very carefully.

Timeouts on all Atlas ops (and heart-beats). This is blocked until we pick a cross-platform runtime library (NSPR, yuck).

Correctly allow externally driven socket notifications (e.g from Gtk+ socket callbacks); this is platform specific and must be #ifdef-ed of course. However it is essential to allow clean integration with main loop-stealing toolkits and libraries.

Handle the 'uptime' attribute of 'Server' objects (the thing returned by anonymous GETs on game servers); need to find out format (string / int) and scale.

[It looks like uptime is of type float/double and measured in seconds. -ZA]


Motion-prediction entity sub-class. Fairly simple initially, assuming no collision detection is done. Again code can be stolen from UClient.

Test compilation on MSVC, Cygwin, Mingw32, Metrowerks / Mac (with GUSI)

[Eris now compiles on MSVC 7, afaik. -ZA]


Fully support inheritance queries, and correctly build and cache the inheritance graph.

Don't crash on unexpected server disconnects
