#more about ID when discussing about MIM (Media Independant Map) -format
## <Jamie> But do they all have object IDs, and how do we keep them seperate from the world ids?
## <aloril> and client can load tgz file too of course..
## <aloril> ahh... namespace question...
## <aloril> well that is problem: current atlas has server specific flat id space for *everything*
## <Jamie> Yes, and do operations share namespace with objects, and can we overload operations?
## <aloril> (attribute names, operations, classes, object ids, type, etc...)
## <Jamie> Can we overload operations?  I think so, looking at the specs
## <aloril> hmm... would that be inheritance?
## <aloril> ie client doesn't know what it's and uses parent definition instead
## <kosh> sorry afk walking someone through installing windows 98
## <Jamie> I am not sure.. But if I pass it a list/int or 3 ints seperatly a move might be able to understand both... location=(1,2,3) or x=1,y=2,z=3...
## <aloril> about how to keep MIM id's separate from world ids... server specific thing, could for example add 'M' to start...
## <aloril> ahh... that... hmm.. probably better have only one format when transmitting..
## <Jamie> Well, I see the world made up as alot of MIM maps all connected, so ids between maps need to be kept seperate as well.  Why not anything with MIM_ in the xml spec or some other special code in other specs to identify it?
## <kosh> everyone has to feel sorry for me since I am walking someone through isntalling windows 98
## <kosh> :)
## <aloril> jamie, server can freely use whatever id scheme it wants...
## <aloril> thats why they are strings ;-)
## <Jamie> True
## <aloril> for example: "M_area1_123"
## <Jamie> But protocols can drop the strings and use anything it wants, as long as it keeps a conversion list local.
## <aloril> client of course can keeps it's own id system and translate between strings and ints ..
## * aloril nods
## <aloril> server ha total freedom in ids, client's must translate..
## <Jamie> So if I map "Mim_area1_123" to 1233455 the protocol only needs to handle int's, and it can make up anything on the client side.
## <aloril> ie this is case where we sacrifice some 0.01% of client CPU for server ;-)
## <Jamie> *nods*
## <Drew> kosh, how can someone not be able to do it alone?
## <kosh> you would be amazed
## <aloril> or was it 0.1% don't remember offhand but it was really small amount...
## <Jamie> Not a large one.
## <aloril> only restriction is that you can't use '/' character and similar characters that are used in URI for other purposes
## <aloril> much more time goes for marshalling all tags but still probably <1%
## <aloril> (assuming binary here)
## <kosh> drew after walking a newbie through windows over the phone I saw all the points they got hung up one windows is not easy to install
## <Drew> kosh, oh? Such as? (I'm not defending Win, just curious since I think it's so easy)
## <kosh> I thought it was easy also but things like installing drivers she got hung up on
## <kosh> or how to just start
## <Drew> Ah, I see.
## <kosh> we had to change her BIOS to support CD rom booting to continue
## <kosh> another example was when installing on some menus she asked me what the question meant since she did not understand
## <Drew> Hmm.
## * Drew points kosh to #lounge...
## * Drew knows that he might be too busy.
## <aloril> hmm... mail.worldforge.org seems down...
## <aloril> if we used ints:
## <aloril> Integer: 1100K/s
## <aloril> String: 350K/s
## <aloril> client needs to still do map (or hash lookup) above is STL map
## <aloril> Lets assume 10B/msg.
## <aloril> Lets assume about 8KB/s or 800msg/s in bandwidth.
## <aloril> Integer: 0.07% of CPU.
## <aloril> String:  0.2% of CPU.
## <aloril> Result:  0.13% difference
## <aloril> whole message is at scripting@ archives

## <aloril> get:

## <aloril> and server then tells: what of root leaf objets have changed objects somewhere in tree

## <aloril> oh yes... now I remember why I made them different:
## <aloril> they don't set contains list to certain value, they only tell about special dynamic field...
## <aloril> another option instead of stamp_instance would be "contains_changed" and "instance_changed"
## <aloril> and when you request it with certain stamp it would list all things that have changed:
## <aloril> if contains -attribute itself has changed: it would present with new list
## <Jamie> Well, how does the server know to send a list of contents_changed or instances_changed instead of the object it's self?
## <aloril> if only contained objects have changed (but no additions/deletions): then list only contains_changed
## <Jamie> Oh, so it returns all all the time.
## <aloril> yes.. if it has changed..
## <aloril> example:
## <aloril> table position changed:
## <Jamie> I understand
## <aloril>   stamp update: send only position
## * aloril typing for docs
## <aloril> if cup added and pos changed
## <Jamie> *nods*
## <aloril> send position, contains and contains_changed
## <aloril> if cup position changed: send only contains_changed
## <ZW> query -- if you are in a room/container and another actor moves an object, isnt that event propogated to all actors in the container so they can update state immedaitly ??
## * aloril is going to commit discussion results as comments to def files (and later add them proper)
## <aloril> ZW: yes
## <aloril> contains_changed is when you reloginm awake, etc... or something stroll in to view
## <ZW> then why would I ever need to scan for changed objects if I already have the current state ??
## <aloril> (contains_changed then is used to see what it wears now)
## <aloril> ZW: then you don't... but normal clients will frequently encounter situation when they don't have current state
## <ZW> k... so you are saying that if I go offline for several hours I remember the last state and lony need to get the changes when I log back in rather than all the info for the current container ???
## <Jamie> ZW: When you log in and want to know what basic things have changed... for example an "account" might have an extra field
## <aloril> ZW: this same method works for updating operation, class, etc.. defitions, only then it's instance_changed
## * aloril nods to ZW
## <ZW> understand it at that level... was tryuing to understand in game context
## * ZW doesnt quite agree, thinks that is caching too much of the game state at the client
## <anubis> hmm, but the server won't know what has changed between the clients disconnect/reconnect since an ai script has been keeping up the slack. so does the server have to store all evens since forever to know what to update from when?
## <aloril> ZW: they don't need to cache... if they don't want it ;-)
## <anubis> seems like client should just request full dump and then can optimize if it has stored info
## <aloril> anubis, nope client stores it's latest stamp, server can always send more than needed
## <ZW> Anubis -- nope -- just sends current state on connect for whats "in view" of the actor
## <aloril> for example if clients latest status was: "50.0"
## <anubis> aloril: but then server has to know diff between every stamp and current
## <anubis> zw; that's what I was thinking
## <aloril> hmm...
## <aloril> for example if clients latest status was: "150.0"
## <aloril> servers current state is 200.0 and latest 'saved' state is 100.0
## <aloril> then server sends changes since 100.0
## <aloril> if no saved state: send everything...
## <ZW> Tacendia even goes so far as to send locations of trees/rocks.buildings/etc for the display redering... someone may have chopped down a tree :)))
## <aloril> of course server could do this: save stamp for each attribute and/or stamp for object
## <Jamie> Er.. Traverse the tree, looking for stamps newer than what the client has, and send them all
## <aloril> jamie, ohh.. thats short and good explanation
## <anubis> aloril: but in most instances of long disconnects, why bother traversing the tree?  wouldn't that be less effient than just a full dump?
## <ZW> jamie -- on a huge world with 100,000 + objects and actors -- that could take a while :)))
## <aloril> anubis, it's full dump in 10-40 iterations
## <anubis> if stamp is < a certain window, do incremental
## <anubis> if stamp > window, full dump
## * aloril nods to anubis
## <aloril> server implementation specific how to do it
## <Jamie> ZW: My point:  Don't send all the actors/objects, just entities with children.  These are the basic structures and a very small set
## <anubis> my guess is that window is going to be a matter of minutes, but you're right...its implementation specific
## <ZW> just asking why I care anything about stuff outside my view -- when I walk into a new area I get the updates wether or not I've cached data
## <aloril> no need to even have stamp, but .. probably useful optimization ;-)
## <kosh> you should not ever been sent anything outside your view
## <kosh> that would allow someone to cheat too easily
## * aloril nods to kosh
## <aloril> ZW: it's client specific decision...
## <aloril> ZW: if client is sophisticated: cache as much as possible
## * ZW agrees with kosh, wonders why optimizing what even in an outdoor scene is gonna be a relitivly small dataset to synchronize
## <aloril> ZW: if client is simple, get everything every time (using stamp 0.0)
## <anubis> stamp is probably needed for debugging/optimization, but might be ignorable for running world
## <aloril> ZW: it's not actually small optimization, example:
## <ZW> Aloril --- my idea of usig a cut-down server for the client would give you the sophisticated caching you need.. but dont see cause to abuse it
## <aloril> ZW: you revolve: things appear and disappear in rapif succession
## <aloril> ZW: of course server can do: you see to all directions ;-)
## <aloril> s/rapif/rapid/
## <ZW> aloril -- you are standing in place or revolving or whatever -- averything within a certain radius was sent to you the moment you entered that radius
## <ZW> now you can revolve without any updates or field of view concerns
## * aloril nods to ZW: again implementation specific
## <ZW> s/you entered/the object entered/
## <aloril> if you don't make things disappear when revolving, you don't need to make them appear either..
## <anubis> ZW: the server should only send the update when you are facing the right way and its w/in the radius
## <anubis> client can store info and keep displaying it, but things may jump when player turns a given direfinds things moved
## <ZW> but thats not taking advantage of client caching in an obvious case where fast change of view is possible
## <ZW> i.e. rotating in place
## <anubis> direfinds/direction and finds
## <anubis> ZW: it is, but the client won't get an update it shouldn't
## <anubis> the client can assume things are static
## <anubis> and that will almost always be correct
## <anubis> but if I shoot an arrow at your back, you shouldn't see it
## <ZW> then when I start rotating I have to wait on server latency before I see the theif creeping up behind me ???
## <anubis> there are the two cases :)
## <cyanide> well if something ought to stop you rotating...
## <anubis> pick your balance point
## <ZW> anubis -- the client may not display it, but needs to be aware of it
## *** BS_AWAY is now known as Bloodspor
## <aloril> ZW: note that we assume hacked clients..
## * Bloodspor goes to work on the waterfall again
## <anubis> ZW: but the client isn't a fixed thing.  we can't prevent a 'hacked' client from displaying that
## <aloril> hi bloodspor
## <Drew> What about the overhead client? The player will only what's in front of him?
## <Bloodspor> heya aloril
## <anubis> so it ought to be controlled server side
## <aloril> drew: client specific decision: it might grey things for example
## <anubis> drew: I would again say you get updates from field of characters view, the rest is cached
## <aloril> that are outside view
## <anubis> and not updated untill in characters field of view again
## <ZW> not having source code never stopped people from hacking diablo -- hacking is a price you pay for publishing a game
## <anubis> ZW: yes, hacking will happen
## <anubis> so prevent cheating by not giving away privledged info
## <aloril> ZW: yes... thats why we design things with assumption of hacked client ;-)
## <cyanide> the client knows as much as the player should, is the general rule
## <ZW> and reduce playability by introducing server latency in every movement the player makes... I'll risk the hackers
## <aloril> ZW: client can always assume things: more client knows about server, more accurately it can simulate things
## <Jamie> No... I am making my client have a local cache, and update as soon as it is asked.  The confirmation comes from teh server.  This is just like quake works.
## <anubis> ZW: you can't avoid the latency.  That thief won't see you turn until your client sends the info, the server processes it, and broadcasts it
## <aloril> ZW: have you read http://unreal.epicgames.com/Network.htm ?
## <ZW> anubis --- I understand that -- but if I turn and he doent pop up in my field of view until  have turned past him.. thats BAD
## <anubis> ZW: yes.  latency sucks one way or the other.  various implementations can deal with that different ways.  But I see your point
## <aloril> ZW: thats why operations have time field: you send both appear and disappear with slightly different time attribute at the same time
## <aloril> so yes... client might make some things seem like they appeared in greyed area ;-)
## <ZW> but the client still doesnt have the info to display the theif until I have roated another 5/10/15 degrees/whatever amount server latency translates into).. so I turn around... there is nothing behind me -- then POOF -- there is a thief !!! (where the hell did HE come from ???)
## <aloril> IRC==insta raw atlas docs ;-)
## <anubis> ZW: if the client tells the server you faced the right way at the right time, it will send a thief update
## <anubis> you may be overrotated a bit, but you'll suddenly see the thief
## <ZW> sure -- 500-1500 milliseconds after I am facing that way !!!
## <aloril> ZW: yes.. that sucks but can be little mitigated by client<->client communication
## <ZW> (0.5-1.5 secs)
## <aloril> (assuming far clients, or maybe by using proxy)
## <anubis> ZW: turn slower ;)
## <aloril> ZW: same with if you drop vase and somebody with really nice connection graps it before it breaks..
## <anubis> remember also your field of view is probably 180 degrees
## <aloril> ZW: clients with nice simulated physics will see it get fixed ;-)
## <ZW> sory -- I refuse to even allow the possibility in any game world I design --- but the server core will handle your way or my way just as easily -- have a blast :)))
## <Drew> I guess for that matter you could just spin around all the time and see all around you.
## <aloril> ZW: note that usully however things work like excepted and with proxies even more... but that is price we pay for having 'hack proof' clients
## * anubis adds a dizziness attribute
## <ZW> Aloril -- how can physics fix a lack of info for physics code to operate on without the client display running lag-time *2 behind game clock ??
## <aloril> ZW: server doesn't fix anything, client fixes failed predictions
## <aloril> ZW: if you couldn't do something because lag: though luck...
## <ZW> by poofing up the thief after I have turned and seen an empty street
## <aloril> ZW: from server viewpoint you haven't turned away from thief yet..
## *** scromp (^bnaylor@haybaler.sackheads.org) has joined #forge
## <brenda> hi scromp
## <aloril> wb scromp
## <ZW> the only fix is that I hit the key to turn and I dont turn until server sez I have -- introducing a lagtime*2 response delay to any action
## <anubis> hi scromp
## <anubis> ZW: the trick is that you have to think you could be the thief, or the victim.  Try to balance the game for both.
## <ZW> or have the data there and forget the hackers
## <aloril> ZW: ahh.. but how often character revole continuoysly? hmm.. quick look has same effect though
## <ZW> initiative plays a factor -- the thief has the advantage because he started the attack before you noticed he was there and turned
## <aloril> ZW: here is solution: privileged proxy near client
## <aloril> with small lag
## <anubis> aloril: interesting idea
## <aloril> ZW: yes.. you can send data and hope people don't use hacked client
## <ZW> aloril --- while I have an idea for using multicast pipes between distributed nodes of a game world server -- I'm not sure how well that idea will work yet
## <aloril> but... better assume other way...
## <ZW> (software multicast routers to provide linkage between widely seperated clusters of servers processing the same game world)
## <ZW> a proxy as you suggest could be a node in such a network
## <aloril> yes... actually you could even kind of run your trusted client in proxy...
## <aloril> all transparent to actual client and server
## <ZW> if the client has data storage and access systems equivalent to a server -- which is what I'm intending
## * ZW wonders what al would think of light-weight encryption to protect the data ??
## <anubis> ZW: the encryption won't make a difference
## <ZW> not make it imposibile to hack.. but harder
## <aloril> ZW: 'just' additional encoding ;-)
## <ZW> true -- OSS strikes again !!
## <anubis> the client has to be able to decrypt the info
## <aloril> ZW: ahh you mean at client?
## <anubis> there was some talk of a checksum or something to give to certified clients
## <ZW> data is stored encrypted and only decrypted when accessed -- prolly too much overhead
## <aloril> ZW: and easily work around..
## <ZW> yes since source is available
## <aloril> ZW: note that even hardware based DVD got hacked ;-)
## * ZW scraps that idea
## <ZW> welp -- different methodologies are why I want the servers the way I do :))) no reason cant have it both ways in different game worlds :))
## * aloril nods
