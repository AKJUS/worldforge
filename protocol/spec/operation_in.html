    <h1>Operations</h1>

    There are two different type of operations:
    Basic level (create,delete,set,get,info) and game specific
    operations (summon,forge, etc...)
    <p>
      Server should send info operations in both format. Clients can
      always interpret info about create,etc.. operations and if they
      know more complex ones they can play suitable animation or NPC
      can remember somebody stealing etc...
    <p>
      When client wants to do something or get info about something,
      it sends some operation derived from action. Server usually
      replies with some operation derived from info, which might embed 
      original action.
    <p>
      <b>Example:</b><br>
      client: forge("jewel_sword","jewels","iron")<br>
      server: sight(forge("jewel_sword","jewels","iron")<br>
      server: info(create("jewel_sword",length=1.2, etc...))<br>
      server: info(set("iron",amount=current-something))<br>
      server: info(destroy("jewels"))
    <p>
      When sending operations use parent:"move" instead of id:"move"<br>
      Reason: so we can distinguish between operation and object that
      tells what operation is about and all operations when used are
      temporary objects anyway (maybe "magical_crunchy_voice_stepping" is not ;-)
