    <h3><a name="intro">Intro</a></h3>

    Server is just some kind of meta world with meta characters (player
    accounts) and 'gateways' to real worlds. So it's handled in many ways
    similar than actual world.
    <p>
      Server differentiates messages meant to meta world from messages 
      meant to actual game from id: messages from player id or if id
      is not specified are meant to meta world. Messages from
      character id are for actual game world.

    <h3><a name="connect">Connection and disconnection</a></h3>
    
    When you connect, standard xml starting tags and opening atlas tag
    with version attribute.
    <p>
    Binary note: in binary this is more or less different! (Either
    binary="yes" or completely different)
    <p>
    Example:
    <PRE>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE atlas protocol "atlas.dtd"&gt;
&lt;atlas version="0.2"&gt;
    </PRE>
    In future there will be additional tags for setting binary and/or
    compression flags.
    <p>
    When you disconnect, send closing atlas tag.
    <p>
    Binary note: in binary this is more or less different! And
      participants needs to handle gracefully abrupt disconnection too
      (somebody unplugged connection).
    <p>
    Example:
    <PRE>
&lt;/atlas&gt;

    <h3><a name="browsing">Browsing server</a></h3>

    You can get list of games by sending this to server:

    <ul>
      <li>:
        <ul>
          <li>id:"get"
          <li>object:
            <ul>
              <li>id:"games"
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    Server tells what games it contains:

    <ul>
      <li>:
        <ul>
          <li>id:"games"
          <li>contains:
            <ul>
              <li>id:"Medieval fantasy game"
              <li>id:"Warcraft clone
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    Further request might require that you are logged in. Especially
    getting list of players likely requires account with 'admin'
    privileges. Creating characters too likely requires player
    account.
    <p>
    <hr>

    <h3><a name="player">Creating player account and login</a></h3>

    If you don't have account, you need to create one. If you already
    have account, then creating new one might be against server
    policy. So usually there should only be one player account per
    real human.
    <p>
      Creating account (this is likely to change somewhat, one
      modification might be to require mail address where password is
      then sent):

    <ul>
      <li>:
        <ul>
          <li>id:"create"
          <li>:
            <ul>
              <li>name:"JoeBlatz"
              <li>password:"Rqv67.%"
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    In response server sends 'info' or 'error' operation back (with
    includes player account id (might be same as account name). refno
    -attribute helps you to spot right answer.
    <p>
    If you already have account then you log in using it:
    <ul>
      <li>:
        <ul>
          <li>id:"login"
          <li>:
            <ul>
              <li>name:"JoeBlatz"
              <li>password:"Rqv67.%"
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3><a name="character">Creating character and using it</a></h3>

    Usually new accounts might be allowed to create only one character
    (part of time it might be controlled by player and other time it
    might be controlled by AI script). Trusted accounts might be
    allowed to create several characters (usually controlled by NPC AI
    script).
    <p>
      Creating character:
      
    <ul>
      <li>:
        <ul>
          <li>no:3
          <li>from:"JoeBlatz"
          <li>id:"create"
          <li>:
            <ul>
              <li>type:"evoker"
              <li>name:"Evoker the magnificent"
              <li>INT:15
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    Server sends back character entity with id and additional
    attributes like location, etc... or error message telling what is
    wrong (like too big value for some attribute). Server might
    assign other values for attributes than client has
    specified. refno -attribute helps you to spot right answer.
    <p>
      If you have already created character then you just continue
      playing where you left. In both cases it might be goo idea to
      use look operation without arguments as starting point:

    <ul>
      <li>:
        <ul>
          <li>from:"character_id_23"
            <li>id:"look"
        </ul>
    </ul>
