    <h1>Bach syntax</h1>

Current negotiation identifier is <b>Bach_beta2</b>. Final will be <b>Bach</b>.
<p>
Elements in mapping and lists are separated with <b>,</b>.
<p>
Mapping is surrounded with <b>{}</b>. Elements in mapping are encoded as
name:value. Name is encoded without quotes if it consists of digits or
uppercase or lowercase letter <b>(a-z)</b> or <b>_</b>. Name must not start with a
number. Quoted name can contain anything, see strings. Value can be
anything.
<p>
List is surrounded with <b>[]</b>. Values can be anything.  Top level
object in streams is a list. So stream starts with <b>[</b> and ends
with <b>]</b> (same as &lt;atlas&gt; and &lt;/atlas&gt; in XML).
<p>
Integer can start with <b>+-</b> (optional) and digits.
<p>
Float numbers consist of mantissa and exponent (optional). Mantissa can contain
one <b>.</b>. Otherwise they are encoded as integers and are separated with
<b>e</b> or <b>E</b> (in case there is an exponent).
<p>
String is surrounded with <b>"</b> and <b>"</b> is quoted as <b>\"</b>
and <b>\</b> is quoted as <b>\\</b>. (in future may allow octals and
special characters like <b>\n</b>).
<p>
# is comment character: all character from this to end of line is comment.
(Might be some day decoded as "comment" -attribute or something equivalent)
<p>
Whitespace is allowed outside values and names (Regular expression <b>\s</b>
or any of <b>\t \n\r\f\v</b>).
<p>
Example:
<pre>
{
   parents: ["info"], 
   arg: {
     name: "Joe", 
     pos: [4.5, 6.7, 2.3], 
     meaning_of_life: 42
   }
}
</pre>
