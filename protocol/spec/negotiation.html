    <h1>Codec negotiation</h1>

    All commands are delimited with newline ("\n").
    <ul>
      <li>First both client and server sends arbitary greeting string
        starting with "ATLAS" like, "ATLAS server libAtlasPy\n".
      <li>If first 5 letters are not "ATLAS", then reply with
      "Huh?\n\n" and close connection

      <li>Then client sends list of codecs it supports prefixed with
      "ICAN ", official ones for are:
        <ul>
          <li>XML
          <li>Packed
        </ul>

        Unofficial ones should be prefixed with "X-".<br>
        After it has sent list, it sends empty line "\n".
      <li>Then server sends codec it will use, example: "IWILL XML\n\n"
        Or if none found, then it can optionally send list of codecs
        it supports using "ICAN foo\n" format.

      <li>After server has selected codec both can start streaming
        actual Atlas operations.
    </ul>

    Amount of things sent at one time should not change logic: other
    side can send one or many lines in one chunk. 
    <p>
      Server might also be non responding variety: Example when you
      area reading from local file (file=server, program reading from
      file=client). In this case server sends whole negotiation and
      following data in arbitrary chunks (including line breaks, etc..)
      depending how you read things from file.
    <p>
    All unknown commands should be ignored.
    <p>
    Example:
    <pre>
Server: "ATLAS server libAtlasPy\n"
Client: "ATLAS client UClient\nICAN Packed\nICAN XML\n\n"
Server: "IWILL XML\n\n"
    </pre>

    Example when saving to file:
    <pre>
    "ATLAS mapeditor foo 0.3.4\nIWILL XML\n\n"
    &lt;atlas&gt;
        ..... here actual objects....
    &lt;/atlas&gt;
    </pre>
