    <h3><a name="containers">Containers and coordinates</a></h3>

    To specify location of object you need to have reference
    (container) object and position in relation to reference object.
    Object also lists all objects that use it as reference coordinate
    system.

    <p>

      Attributes:<br>

    <ul>
      <li>loc: id of object that this object is using as reference
        coordinate system (top level world/universe object specifies this
        as empty)<br>
        <strong>Note</strong> that this is different than physical
        containership: it is usually same as physical container, but
        <strong>not</strong> necessarily
      <li>pos: position in relation to reference object (or absolute
        position for top level object)
      <li>velocity: velocity of object in relation to reference object
        (or absolute for velocity for top level object)
      <li>contains: objects that use this as reference system (things
        that don't contain anything have this as empty)
    </ul>

    To calculate absolute coordinates you do this:
<PRE>
def get_absolute_position(self):
    if not self.ref: return self.pos
    return self.pos + self.ref.get_absolute_position()
</PRE>

    As you can see from above code assumption is logically 'tree' like
    container structure.
    <p>
    If world designer wants to use only one coordinate system and
    still have containers: Specify pos as 0,0,0 for all objects except 
    bottom level ones.

    <h3><a name="types">Movement types</a></h3>

      container, relative==relative to current location</strong>

    <p>
    <b>Server  should always support less accurate movement:</b>
    <p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>Advanced server:</td><td>a,b,c</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Less advanced server:</td><td>a,b</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Simple server:</td><td>a</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    Same for client.
    Client tries most advanced method of moving and if it gets illegal
    event back then it falls back to less advanced method.
    <p>
    Server implementation could be something like this:
    server:b, client:a
    Create appropriate force vector for requested move difference and use
    it as if that was requested.
    <p>
    When 'force' -tag is used by client, then likely server sends
    movement sights using 'vector' -tag.
    <p>
    <b>Why?</b>
    <p>
    It would be nice if server would work with less advanced clients and
    vice versa. We can't immediately implement some very detailed
    moving. It's just that when client uses less accurate 'movement type'
    then (s)he cannot control her/his character as accurately.  For some
    programs it doesn't make even sense to do it initially (like some
    existing program).

    <h3><a name="loc">Location tag</a></h3>
    
    <em>This section needs rewrite</em>
    <p>
    This is current/new location for entity.
    It contains id, position and optionally orientation.
    <p>
    Id: Entity that acts as reference for location.
    <p>
    Either pos, vector or forcevector is used for position. Units
    are in meters unless something different has been decided between
    server and client.
    <p>
    Pos: absolute coordinates in relation to reference entity.
    Example (x,y,z):
    <ul>
      <li>pos:12.4,23.2,-0.5
    </ul>
    <p>
    Vector: relative to receiving character. Example:
    <ul>
       <li>vector:12.4,23.2,-0.5
    </ul>
    <p>
    Forcevector: Force relative to receiving character. Default unit
    is newton. Example:
    <ul>
       <li>forcevector:12.4,23.2,-0.5
    </ul>
    <p>
    Either rotation, relrotation or torquerotation is used for
    rotation. Units are in radians unless something different has been
    decided between server and client.
    <p>
    Rotation: Absolute rotation in relation to reference
    entity. Example (x,y,z -axis):
    <ul>
       <li>rotation:0.1,-0.2,2.0
    </ul>
    <p>
    Relrotation: Relative rotation in relation to receiving character. Example:
    <ul>
       <li>relrotation:0.1,-0.2,2.0
    </ul>
    <p>
    Forcerotation: Relative torque in relation to receiving
    character. Default unit is newton meter. Example:
    <ul>
       <li>torquerotation:0.1,-0.2,2.0
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h3><a name="absolute">Containers and absolute movement</a></h3>
    
    You are on ship that moves at sea.
    <p>
    You move (no need to specify ship, reference container not changed):
    <ul>
      <li>id:"you_123"
      <li>pos:10.5, 5.0, 4.0
    </ul>

    Ship moves (again container doesn't change):
    <ul>
      <li>id:"ship_12"
      <li>pos:30000.0, 300000.0, 0.0
    </ul>

    Sea moves:
    <ul>
      <li>id:"sea_1"
      <li>pos:0.0, 0.0, 1.0
    </ul>

    Somebody else moves on same ship (just like your movement):
    <ul>
      <li>id:"somebody_else_1234"
      <li>pos:12.0, 4.0, 4.0
    </ul>

    Another ship moves (just like ship movement):
    <ul>
      <li>id:"ship2_33"
      <li>pos:30010.0, 300020.0, 0.0
    </ul>

    You jump to another ship:
    <ul>
      <li>id:"you_123"
      <li>loc:"ship2_33"
      <li>pos:4.0, 5.0, 3.0
    </ul>

    You jump to sea:
    <ul>
      <li>id:"you_123"
      <li>loc:"sea_1"
      <li>pos:30020.0, 300020.0, 0.0
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="relative">Containers and relative movement</a></h3>

    "vector" attribute might change to "add_pos" attribute.<br>
    (relative movement not used yet in any Atlas server)
    <p>
    You are on ship that moves at sea.
    <p>
    You move: ship has moved in relation to you:
    <ul>
      <li>id:"you_123"
      <li>loc:"ship_12"
      <li>vector:-4.5, 2.0, 0.0
    </ul>

    Ship moves: sea has moved in relation to ship:
    <ul>
      <li>id:"ship_12"
      <li>loc:"sea_1"
      <li>vector:0.1, 5.0, 0.0
    </ul>

    Sea moves: you don't notice.
    <p>
    Somebody else moves on same ship: somebody has moved in relation
    to you:
    <ul>
      <li>id:"somebody_else_1234"
      <li>loc:"ship_12"
      <li>vector:-0.5, 2.0, 0.0
    </ul>

    Another ship moves: ship2 has moved in relation to your ship:
    <ul>
      <li>id:"ship2_33"
      <li>loc:"sea_1"
      <li>vector:-3.1,1.2, 0.0
    </ul>

    You jump to another ship:
    <ul>
      <li>id:"you_123"
      <li>loc:"ship2_33"
      <li>vector:1.0, 5.0, -1.0
    </ul>

    You jump to sea:
    <ul>
      <li>id:"you_123"
      <li>loc:"sea_1"
      <li>vector:0.0, 1.0, -4.0
    </ul>
