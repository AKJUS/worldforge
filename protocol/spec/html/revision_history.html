    <h2>Whats new in v0.2.4</h2>

    Removed typed lists and uri as encoding types. They are now
    abstract types. Map is called mapping to differentiate between
    geographical maps and object encoding key&lt-&gt;value mappings.
    Some simple beginnings of map definition is added.
    XML syntax is changed and Packed encoding is added.
    ACHAT encoding negotiation is added.
    <p>
    Flattened structures and renamed some attributes and values:
    <pre>
abstract_type -&gt; objtype
loc.ref -&gt; loc
loc.coords -&gt; pos
loc.velocity -&gt; velocity
time.seconds -&gt; seconds
time.future_seconds -&gt; future_seconds
time.time_string -&gt; time_string
parent-&gt;parents
instance-&gt;children

objtype values changed:
"operation" -&gt; "op"
"operation_definition" -&gt; "op_definition"
    </pre>

    <h2>Whats new in v0.2.3</h2>

    Old obj_list type was splitted to list and map types. XML syntax
    has changed to be easier to read and still keeping type info
    intact. These changes were suggested by John Barret.
    <p>
    Conversation examples added for <a href="operation.html#login">login</a>, <a href="operation.html#look">look</a> and <a href="operation.html#move">move</a> -operations.
    "game_interface" -object added. "abstract_type" -attribute for
    operations and their instances was changed.
    <p>
      <a href="ftp://ftp.worldforge.org/worldforge/users/aloril/atlas/cyphesis_atlas_XML_0_2_3.log">Here</a> 

      is example log with cyphesis_server.py and ObserverClient.py . 
      Note that it does have Cyphesis specific additions and probably
      still has some bugs in compliance.
    </p>

    <h2>Whats new in v0.2.2</h2>

    example, stamp_inherit and stamp_contains attributes added and
    basic examples to operations done
    <p>
      <a href="ftp://ftp.worldforge.org/worldforge/users/aloril/atlas/cyphesis_atlas_XML_0_2_2.log">Here</a> 

      is example log with cyphesis_server.py and ObserverClient.py . 
      Note that it does have Cyphesis specific additions and probably
      still has some bugs in compliance.
    </p>

    <h2>Whats new in v0.2.1</h2>

    Some fixes and id physical_type has been renamed to uri. XML
    float_list and int_list syntax has been changed to more natural
    XML (and somewhat easier to parse using XML library)

    <h2>Whats new in v0.2.0</h2>

    v0.2.0 is basically combination of v0.1.4 and Wds by Jamie and
    Mike's &lt;obj&gt; syntax
