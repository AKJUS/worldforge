    <h1>Simple Core Atlas</h1>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>

    Expressing an Atlas object in the common Bach encoding form:
    <pre>
{
   parents: ["info"], 
   objtype:"op",
   arg: {
     name: "Joe", 
     pos: [4.5, 6.7, 2.3], 
     meaning_of_life: 42
   }
}
    </pre>

    In above example "parents" is list attribute containing one string value "info".
    <br> Arg is mapping attribute containing 3 attributes:<br>
    "name" is string attribute with value "Joe",<br>
    "pos" is list attribute with 3 float values [4.5, 6.7, 2.3]<br>
    and "meaning_of_life" is integer attribute with value 42.
    <p>
      Above example also "specifies" Bach encoding for most
      purposes. List is enclosed with [], mapping is enclosed with
      {} and string is enclosed with "".

      <h2>Core operations</h2>

    Operation consist of operation name as value to "parents"
    attribute and argument to it as value to "arg"
    attribute. "parents" is used as attribute name because full Atlas
    implements inheritance. See tree creation example later for entity
    example.
    <p>
      Operation example:
    <pre>
{
    parents: ["operation_name"],
    objtype:"op",
    arg: <b>some object here</b>
}
    </pre>

    Object given in argument can be either some other operation or
    entity. Entity example:
    <pre>
{
    id: "tree23",
    objtype:"obj",
    parents: ["tree"],
    pos: [1.2, 5.6, 1.0]
}
    </pre>

    Id of entity is "tree23", class of entity is "tree" and position is [1.2,
    5.6, 1.0] = [x,y,z]


    <h3>Get operation</h3>

    To fetch some object from server, use get operation and give it id of object as argument.

    Example:
    <pre>
{
    parents: ["get"],
    objtype:"op",
    arg: {id: "tree34"}
}
    </pre>
    For example of what server returns see <a href="#info">Info operation</a>.

    <h3>Set operation</h3>

    To set values in object use set operation and into arg put id of
    object and new values for attributes.

    Example:
    <pre>
{
    parents: ["set"],
    objtype:"op",
    arg: {id: "joe56", name: "Michael"}
}
    </pre>


    <h3>Create operation</h3>

    To create new object use create operation and into arg put
    object. Usually server assigns id, but if it's dumb server you
    need to give id also.

    Example:
    <pre>
{
    parents: ["create"],
    objtype:"op",
    arg: {parents:["tree"], pos: [1.2, 5.6, 1.0]}
}
    </pre>


    <h3>Delete operation</h3>

    To delete object in server, use delete operation and give id of
    object being deleted as argument.

    Example:
    <pre>
{
    parents: ["delete"],
    objtype:"op",
    arg: {id: "tree34"}
}
    </pre>


    <a name="info">
    <h3>Info operation</h3>

    Info operation is returned by server either as reply to get
    operation or informing you that somebody (might be you) made
    changes in server.
    <p>
    Reply to "get" operation example:
<pre>
{
    parents: ["info"],
    objtype:"op",
    arg: {id: "tree34", parents:["tree"], pos: [1.2, 5.6, 1.0]}
}
</pre>

    Reply to "set" operation example:
<pre>
{
    parents: ["info"],
    objtype:"op",
    arg: {
        parents: ["set"],
        objtype:"op",
        arg: {id: "joe56", name: "Michael"}
    }
}
</pre>

    Reply to "create" operation example:
<pre>
{
    parents: ["info"],
    objtype:"op",
    arg: {
        parents: ["create"], 
        objtype:"op",
        arg: {id: "tree34", parents:["tree"], pos: [1.2, 5.6, 1.0]}
    }
}
</pre>

    Reply to "delete" operation example:
<pre>
{
    parents: ["info"],
    objtype:"op",
    arg: {
        parents: ["delete"], 
        objtype:"op",
        arg: {id: "tree34"}
    }
}
</pre>
