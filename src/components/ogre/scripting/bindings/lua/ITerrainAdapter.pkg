/**
Acts as a bridge between the Mercator terrain system and the Ogre terrain rendering engine. We don't want to directly interface with the terrain rendering system since we want to have the ability to replace or alter that, thus we use an instance of this whenever we need to interact directly to it.

Thus, if you have a feature which requires some kind of interfacing with the terrain rendering system that's not currently available, this is where you put it (and then implement it in the concrete class which implements this interface).
