/**
 * @brief Specifies geometry of an entity.
 *
 * The attribute "type" defines the shape of the geometry.
 * Possible values:
 *
 * "sphere"    : A sphere
 * "box"
 * "capsule-z" : A capsule, oriented along the z axis
 * "capsule-x" : A capsule, oriented along the x axis
 * "capsule-y" : A capsule, oriented along the y axis
 * "cylinder-z": A cylinder, oriented along the z axis
 * "cylinder-x": A cylinder, oriented along the x axis
 * "cylinder-y": A cylinder, oriented along the y axis
 * "mesh"      : An arbitrary mesh, using vertices and indices.
 *               Mesh data is either read from the "path", or supplied "vertices" and "indices" attributes.
 *               When the entity has no mass (is "static") a high fidelity mesh will be used.
 *               When it has mass however (i.e. reacts to physics) a convex hull will be used instead. This is for performance reasons.
 * "compound"  : Composed by multiple simpler shapes. Use this when you want a shape which retains its detail even when non-static.
 *
 * In addition a "path" attribute can be specified, pointing to a mesh file.
 * If the "mesh" type is specified, the full mesh data will be read and used.
 * The bounds of the mesh will be used to update the "bbox" property
 * of any TypeNode that this property is applied on.
 *
 * For spheres, capsules and cylinders the smallest axis will be used for scaling, unless a "scaler" parameter is set.
 * "scaler" can be either "min", "max", "x", "y" or "z"
 *
 * @ingroup PropertyClasses
