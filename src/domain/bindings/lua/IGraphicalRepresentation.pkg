 * The entities can be represented through many means inside the world. The most common case would probably be to use an instance of Model, through the ModelRepresentation class, but there are many other cases where another representation would be suitable.
 * All of these representations share this common interface. An instance of this is normally held by an EmberEntity instance.
 *
 * Most of the subclasses of this are expected to provide methods for safely casting into the concrete subclass. The getType() method is expected to be used for helping with this.
