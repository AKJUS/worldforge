Numerous contributions by Ron Steinke including the Perl bindings, WFmath 
conversion and bug reports by the dozen.

Eris would not have been possible without Uclient by Karsten Olaf-Laux, the
first large-scale client to use Atlas. 

Al Riddoch has contributed so many build / packaging fixes, bug reports and 
clarified the Atlas protocol for me on countless occasions. He is truly
the master of autoconf and rpmbuild.
