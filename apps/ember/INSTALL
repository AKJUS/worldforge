Ember Installation Instructions 

Ember uses a lot of internal Worldforge libraries, which might not be supplied by your system.
To help with compilation we therefore strongly recommend that you use the Hammer tool, to be found at http://wiki.worldforge.org/wiki/Hammer_Script
This script will download and install all of the necessary libraries.

Nonetheless, if you want to install from source yourself we hope that this file will give you some guidance.
