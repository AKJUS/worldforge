The latter are identified by always starting with "+", such as "+move_forward". If a "toggle" command is used, an "inverse command" will automatically be generated, accessable through getInverseCommand(). This is meant to be used to act as an inverse of the main command.
     * @param object The object instance. This will receive notifications when the command (and if available the inverse command) is used.
     * @param description Description of the command, to be presented to the end user.
     * @param suppressLogging If true, logging of the registration and deregistration will be suppressed. This is useful if you have a command which you'll add and remove often.
