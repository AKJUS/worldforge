The C++ version of cyphesis was written by Al Riddoch based on the original
Python version written by aloril and other members of the WorldForge
project listed in AUTHORS. My thanks to aloril for all the help
with understanding the python version.

Also thanks to:

Stefanus du Toit for writing Atlas-C++.

Karsten-Olaf Laux, author of uclient, for help and feedback debugging
cyphesis.
