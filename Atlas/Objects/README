The .cc and .h files in here are automatically generated.

This is done by issuing the following:

./gen_cc.py root_entity Entity
./gen_cc.py root_operation Operation

The generation script is a _work in progress_, hence a few things aren't yet
implemented:

 - non-default constructors (not important)
 - Makefile.am generation (not important)
 - Decoder.cc generation (not important)

Please do not touch anything in this directory yet. -- sdt@gmx.net
