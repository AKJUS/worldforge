- add dynamic casting checks

- add Empty object: all values are empty (pos, velocity: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0])

- check that Set{Pos,Velocity}AsList() doesn't changes size from
  default one.

- id's as int/Root/void* in addition to current string

- add IsDefault method for dynamic attributes also
  and test dynamic default values also

- More testing?
