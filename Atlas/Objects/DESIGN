Atlas-C++ - Objects

1. GENERAL NOTES

implement hierarchy as given in atlas spec.
have attributes

2.1 FIRST ITERATION

attributes are message::objects
attributes are stored in a map
attributes can be checked for
attributes can be retrieved
attributes can be stored
attributes can be removed
objects have default attributes (set in constructors)

somehow we should be able to conver Objects to Message::Objects

2.1.1 INHERITANCE

We use public inheritance
We use virtual functions
In constructors:
  - First we call our parent
  - Then we do our own thing
In GetAttr:
  - First check if we have it
  - Then call parent
  - At Root, we throw an exception (maybe)
In SetAttr:
  - No inheritance issues
  - In fact, we can just rely on root's implementation
In RemoveAttr:
  - No inheritance issues
  - In fact, we can just rely on root's implementation

2.2 SECOND ITERATION

attributes can be specific types
attributes can be stored as members
